# Hello-World
Getting Started
Hey there! 

My name is Lena Alonso. I have been teaching for about six year now and have taught many subjects and grade levels. I have had students from the age ranges of 4-30. I have worked with toddlers, children, and adults with cognitive disabilities and have been an elementary school and high school teacher. During my three years teaching high school, I taught critical thinking skills, English I and II, ESOL Reading, and even coached Water Polo. 
Through it all, technology has always been of interest to me, so much so that after completing my Master's degree in Special Education, I decided to enroll in specialist degree for Instructional Technology. It was in this program where I was introduced to an introductory coding course. Since then I have been self-teaching myself to code while finishing my degree and teaching. 
I have a passion for learning, and bettering myself. I am committed to this learning process in hopes of transitioning careers into a developer position. 
Through GitHub, I hope to create a professional portfolio, collaborate with other programmers, and share resources with the world.
